# controllers handle the flow of data between the model and the views.

# Controllers manage the flow of data between the Model and View in a web application. They handle user input, interact with the Model to retrieve or update data, and send the processed data to the View for presentation.

# The Model is like the brain of the application. It stores and manages data, makes sure the data is correct, and does calculations or rules for how things should work. It works behind the scenes, allowing the user interface and application logic to interact with data smoothly.

# In MVC architecture, the View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling the user interface. Here are the key roles and responsibilities of a View

# The View is like the face of the application. It shows information to users and lets them interact with buttons and forms. It doesn't decide how things work or process data; it just displays what the user sees and sends their actions to the brain (the Model and Controller) behind the scenes.
